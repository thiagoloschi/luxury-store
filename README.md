### Description
This is a responsive Progressive web app to be used as a store template. In the example, I've used data from the company Farfetch. Hover on the product to see a different image and know what products are on sale. This is ready to be added to your home screen with a few steps. I might do it in the future.

<br /> 

### Technologies
Progressive Web App, React, Redux, Webpack, Nodejs, Styled-components, Jest, Enzyme.

<br />

### Development
